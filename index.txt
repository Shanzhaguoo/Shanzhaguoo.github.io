a:T6fe,This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting. Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and, subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in 3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability. Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

}c:T4e5,The neural implicit surface reconstruction from unorganized points is still challenging, especially when the point clouds are incomplete and/or noisy with complex topology structure. Unlike previous approaches performing neural implicit surface learning relying on local shape priors, this paper proposes to utilize global shape priors to regularize the neural implicit function learning for more reliable surface reconstruction. To this end, we first introduce a differentiable module to generate a smooth indicator function, which globally encodes both the indicative prior and local SDFs of the entire input point cloud. Benefit from this, we propose a new framework, called NeuralIndicator, to jointly learn both the smooth indicator function and neural implicit function simultaneously, using the global shape prior encoded by smooth indicator function to effectively regularize the neural implicit function learning, towards reliable and high-fidelity surface reconstruction from unorganized points without any normal information. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-scan datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms previous approaches, especially when point clouds are incomplete and/or noisy with complex topology structure.d:T6a6,@inproceedings{10.5555/3692070.3692861,
